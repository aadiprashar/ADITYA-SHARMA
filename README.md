# Javascript-NFT-Project
This project is to create an NFT collection using my state "UTTRAKHAND" as the parameter, utilizing resources like zila names, food of the place, tourist attractive places, and its feedback.
This project demonstrates the creation of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) representing various districts in Uttrakhand. Each NFT contains metadata about a district(which called zila in local language), including its name, image(photo), popular travel destinations, local cuisine, and a description. This project uses JavaScript to mint, list, and track these NFTs.

Listing NFTs: Display all minted NFTs with their metadata.
Total Supply: Get the total number of NFTs created.
